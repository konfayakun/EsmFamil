### This is an web-based implementation of a simple game that named "Esm Famil" in Iran.

 This is my first react app.
 Node.js and javascript are used in both server and client sides.  
 Strings stored in a resource file for future multi-language support.  
 Using a mongoDB Database and creating lobby page (improvment on Home.js) is the next phase.  
 Colors are chosen with respect to google material design headlines.
 Node.js version 6+ and npm version 3+ are required for running project.



### Server

* express: 4.16.2
* nodemon: 1.14.3
* socket.io: 2.0.4
